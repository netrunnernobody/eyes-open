eyes open

an interactive phone wallpaper designed to provide easy access to a number of cyberpunk or cyberpunk-adjacent twitter feeds. comes with a rather in-depth notifications manager, a rather lacking device manager, and a very barren cryptocurrency tracker.

originally designed for personal use— because staying informed with cyberpunk-adjacent news was becoming a pain in the ass. because this was built for personal use, it might still have some bugs. sorry.

installation guide

[x]    klwp -> hamburger menu -> load preset -> eyesopen

[x]    nova settings -> home screen

   [x0001]     page indicator -> none
   
   [x0002]     search bar placement -> none
   
   [x0003]     infinite scroll -> on
   
[x]    nova settings -> screen orientation -> force portrait

[x]    desktop -> press and hold -> create a six page layout. make the homepage the last page.

[x]    if dark mode isn’t your thing, go to klwp -> globals -> alttheme. optional, obviously. i recommend dark mode, hence why it’s the default.

future plans

i’d like to do the following, but had to forgo some of it in lieu of getting this out the door by december 2nd:

[x]    fix and optimize for other devices. i’ve only tested this on a oneplus 7 pro. I don’t doubt the possibility of some interesting side effects on other devices.

[x]    replace the news feeds, preferably with actual rss feeds from actual news sites, rather than a hacky scraping attempt from various twitter users. If you have suggestions, I’d love to hear them.

[x]    a visual overhaul, maybe including an actual background, a blinking eye animation, or whatever else smarter, more artsy people think is stylish.

[x]    tablet support, maybe? do people still even use tablets? i can’t imagine this working well on a tablet at the moment, because in the interest of saving time, i completely avoided creating an adaptive design. but i might need to make an adaptive design for this to work properly for other reasons, so who knows.

remember, this is a beta. you'll probably have to tinker with it a bit.
