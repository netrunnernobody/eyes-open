an interactive phone wallpaper designed to provide easy access to a number of cyberpunk or cyberpunk-adjacent twitter feeds. comes with a rather in-depth notifications manager, a rather lacking device manager, and a very barren cryptocurrency tracker.

originally designed for personal use— because staying informed with cyberpunk-adjacent news was becoming a pain in the ass. because this was built for personal use, it might still have some bugs. sorry.

**installation guide**

*    klwp -> hamburger menu -> load preset -> eyesopen

*    nova settings -> home screen -> page indicator -> none

*    nova settings -> home screen -> search bar placement -> none
   
*    nova settings -> home screen -> infinite scroll -> on
   
*    nova settings -> screen orientation -> force portrait

*    desktop -> press and hold -> create a six page layout. make the homepage the last page.

*    if dark mode isn’t your thing, go to klwp -> globals -> alttheme. optional, obviously. in fact, i recommend dark mode, hence why it’s the default.

**future plans**

i’d like to do the following, but had to forgo some of it in lieu of getting this out the door by december 2nd:

*    fix and optimize for other devices. i’ve only tested this on a oneplus 7 pro. I don’t doubt the possibility of some interesting side effects on other devices.

*    replace the news feeds, preferably with actual rss feeds from actual news sites, rather than a hacky scraping attempt from various twitter users. If you have suggestions, I’d love to hear them.

*    a visual overhaul, maybe including an actual background, a blinking eye animation, or whatever else smarter, more artsy people think is stylish.

*    tablet support, maybe? do people still even use tablets? i can’t imagine this working well on a tablet at the moment, because in the interest of saving time, i completely avoided creating an adaptive design. but i might need to make an adaptive design for this to work properly for other reasons, so who knows.

remember, this thing's in beta, and i absolutely lack the budget needed to test this on all devices. you might have to spend a few minutes giving it a tinker. you get what you pay for, etc etc.
